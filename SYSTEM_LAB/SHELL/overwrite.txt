Linux includes redirection commands for each stream. 
These commands write standard output to a file. 
If a non-existent file is targetted (either by a single-bracket or double-bracket command), 
a new file with that name will be created prior to writing.

Overwrite

    > - standard output

Commands with a double bracket do not overwrite the destination's existing contents.

Append

    >> - standard output
