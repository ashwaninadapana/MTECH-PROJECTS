HOW TO RUN:
./client <server_port>
./server <server_port> <client_port>
___________________________________________________________________

1)Uses selective repeat flow control
2)uses independent acknowledgement for each received segment
3)initiate flow function starts sending segments 


handleRetransmissions():  this handles retransmissions after handling 3 duplicate acknowledgements
createClientSocket():  this creates client socket and server socket to create connection between client and server
generateInitialSequenceNum(): this generates initial seq no or we can set it to 0 if we want to start relative sequence no
sendSegment(): sends segment to server
receiveSegment(): receives segment from server
startTimerForHandShake(): starts timer for handshake
markAckReceived(): marks the acknowledgement as received for received acknowledgement
void calculateK(): calculates parameter k which means the time that tcp will take to increase the decreased window size to Wmax if there are no loss
applyWeightGrowthFunction: calculates the weight growth for the next RTT
cubicWindowReduction(): decreases the window size if there is 3 dup ack
void resetCubicParams(): resets the cubic parameters 
checkIfTCPfriendliness(): checks if it is in TCP friendly region
